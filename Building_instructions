For the prior actions, there is an awesome guide:

After these steps:

1) cd "your_path_to_the_source_code"
2) copy local_manifest.xml from this repo to .repo/local_manifests folder (if it doesn't exist, make it)
3) repo sync -j16 
4) . build/envsetup.sh
5) lunch cm_loganreltexx-userdebug
6) time brunch loganreltexx userdebug -j# , where "#" is the number of CPU Cores +1, for example on a Dual Core it will be -j3

**The "userdebug" parameter specifies the build type! Alternatives: user,eng and so on...

*Note: I have created the "mod" branches on kernel repository. Those repositories include all the good kernel stuff, 
like OC, UC, Voltage Control and so on...
If you want to build the kernel which includes those changes you have to switch branch on local_manifest.xml

Example:
Kernel with mods:
<project path="kernel/samsung/msm8930-common" name="kostoulhs/android_kernel_samsung_msm8930-common" remote="github" revision="cm-12.0_mod" />
Kernel without mods:
<project path="kernel/samsung/msm8930-common" name="kostoulhs/android_kernel_samsung_msm8930-common" remote="github" revision="cm-12.0" />
