For the prior actions, there is an awesome guide:

After these steps:

1) mkdir cm12.1
2) cd cm12.1
3) copy local_manifest.xml from this repo to cm12.1/.repo/local_manifests folder (if it doesn't exist, make it)
4) repo sync -j16 
4) . build/envsetup.sh
5) lunch cm_loganreltexx-userdebug -j4
6) time mka bacon -j# , where "#" is the number of CPU Cores +1, for example on a Dual Core it will be -j3

**Note for step 3: .repo is a hidden folder (begins with "."). To make it visible in Ubuntu file manager press Ctrl + H

*Note: I have created the "mod" branches on kernel repository. Those repositories include all the good kernel stuff, 
like OC, UC, Voltage Control and so on...
If you want to build the kernel which includes those changes you have to change "msm8930-common" in this line https://github.com/kostoulhs/android_device_samsung_loganreltexx/blob/cm-12.1/BoardConfig.mk#L33
to "custom_kernel"

In brief:
TARGET_KERNEL_SOURCE         := kernel/samsung/msm8930-common (Stock kernel)
TARGET_KERNEL_SOURCE         := kernel/samsung/custom_kernel  (Mod kernel)
