For the prior actions, there is an awesome guide:

After these steps:

Open a new Terminal:

1) mkdir cm12.1
2) cd cm12.1
3) repo init -u git://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git -b cm-12.1
4) cd .repo && mkdir local_manifests && cd local_manifests && wget https://github.com/kostoulhs/loganreltexx_local_manifest/raw/cm-12.1/local_manifest.xml && cd ~/cm12.1
5) repo sync -j# 
6) . build/envsetup.sh && lunch cm_loganreltexx-userdebug -j4
7) time mka bacon -j# , where "#" is the number of CPU Cores +1, for example on a Dual Core it will be -j3

*Note: I have created the "mod" branches on kernel repository. Those repositories include all the good kernel stuff, 
like OC, UC, Voltage Control and so on...
If you want to build the kernel which includes those changes you have to change "msm8930-common" in this line https://github.com/kostoulhs/android_device_samsung_loganreltexx/blob/cm-12.1/BoardConfig.mk#L33
to "custom_kernel"

In brief:
TARGET_KERNEL_SOURCE         := kernel/samsung/msm8930-common (Stock kernel)
TARGET_KERNEL_SOURCE         := kernel/samsung/custom_kernel  (Mod kernel)
